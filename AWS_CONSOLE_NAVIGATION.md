# AWS Console Navigation Guide

If you can't find the Region or IAM options, here's exactly where to look:

## 🌍 Finding the Region Selector

### Location 1: Top Right Corner (Most Common)
- Look at the **top-right corner** of the AWS Console
- You'll see something like: `N. Virginia` or `us-east-1` or a globe icon 🌐
- Click on it to see all available regions
- **This is where you select your region**

### Location 2: If You Don't See It
1. Make sure you're logged into AWS Console (not just the sign-in page)
2. The region selector appears after you select a service
3. Try navigating to S3 first, then look at the top-right

### Visual Guide:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ AWS Console Header                      │
│                                         │
│  [Services] [Search]  [Region ▼] [User]│ ← Region is here (top-right)
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 👤 Finding IAM (Identity and Access Management)

### Method 1: Using the Search Bar (Easiest)
1. At the **top of the AWS Console**, you'll see a search bar
2. Type: `IAM` or `Identity`
3. Click on **"IAM"** from the search results
4. This will take you directly to IAM

### Method 2: Using Services Menu
1. Click **"Services"** in the top-left corner
2. Look for **"Security, Identity & Compliance"** section
3. Click on **"IAM"** (Identity and Access Management)

### Method 3: Direct URL
- Go directly to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/

### Visual Guide:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Services ▼] [🔍 Search: IAM]          │ ← Type "IAM" here
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 📦 Finding S3
